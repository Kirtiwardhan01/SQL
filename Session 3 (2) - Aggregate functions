Aggregating strings

You are planning to update your storefront window to demonstrate how family-friendly and multi-lingual your DVD collection is
To prepare for this you need to prepare a comma-separated list G-rated film titles by language released in 2010

1. Return a column with a list of comma-separated film titles by using the STRING_AGG() function.
   Limit the results to films that have a release_year of 2010 AND have a rating of 'G'.
   Ensure that the operation is grouped by the language name
   
Answer:
  SELECT name, 
	STRING_AGG(title,',') AS film_titles
  FROM film AS f
  INNER JOIN language AS l
  ON f.language_id = l.language_id
  WHERE release_year = 2010
  AND rating = 'G'
  GROUP BY name;
