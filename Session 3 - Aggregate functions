In this exercise you would like to learn more about the 
differences in payments between the customers who are active and those who are not

1.Identify the number of active and inactive customers by COUNT()ing them

Find out the differences in their average payments by using AVG()

Find out the differences in their total payments by using SUM()

Ensure the aggregate functions GROUP BY whether customer payments are active

Answer:
  SELECT active, 
       COUNT(active) AS num_active, 
       AVG(amount) AS avg_amount, 
       SUM(amount) AS total_amount
  FROM payment AS p
  INNER JOIN customer AS c
  ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
  GROUP BY active;
